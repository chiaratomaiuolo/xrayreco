# X-ray energy and hit position reconstruction on an hexagonal grid
## Goal
The following repository contains the dataset and the code used for training a FFNN for the reconstruction of the _energy_ and _hit position in cartesian coordinates (x,y)_ of X-rays emitted by a Cu source in the K-line, converting in charge in a solid state stadium that hits an hexagonal pixel grid.
