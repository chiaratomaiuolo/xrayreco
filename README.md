# X-ray energy and absorption point reconstruction on an hexagonal readout grid
## Goal
The following repository contains the dataset and the code used for training a FFNN for the reconstruction of the _energy_ and _absorption position in cartesian coordinates (x,y)_ of X-rays emitted by a Cu source in the K-line, absorbed and converted in charge in a solid state stadium. The charge is then collected in an hexagonal pixel grid.
